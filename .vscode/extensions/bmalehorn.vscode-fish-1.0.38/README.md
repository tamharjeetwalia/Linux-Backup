This started out as a combination of two excellent but inactive extension:
[fish-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=skyapps.fish-vscode)
and
[fish-ide](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lunaryorn.fish-ide).

## Keybindings

`Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+F`: Fix indentation in fish file
